# RiseAndShine
HackEd Fall Hackathon 2016

Using:
Adafruit IO
IFTTT - replaced:
Zapier

Hardware:
Feather Huzzah ESP8266

Issues:
Clock display intermittently turns off (due to hardware - no_fix)
Clock can take a very long time (~5min) to update. Has to do with dropped packets?
What if alarm packet is dropped??? Needs testing.
