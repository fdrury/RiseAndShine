# RiseAndShine
HackEd Fall Hackathon 2016

Using:
Adafruit IO
Zapier (tested and seems better than IFTTT)
^ Does run automatically

Hardware:
Feather Huzzah ESP8266

Issues:
Clock display intermittently turns off (due to hardware - wontFix)
alarm is give-or-take 5 minutes.
What if alarm packet is dropped??? Needs testing.
Alarm can only go for a second. Why?
